Hello! It’s been a while. Things have been hectic here and are finally settling down a little bit, so I thought it was about time for another post. In case you didn’t know, I’ve switched jobs and have gone from Staff Engineer at the Economist to Senior Engineer at Octopus Energy Engineering. I might do a separate post one day about that decision and why I think it was the right one for me. So far, I am very much enjoying coding more again and having a bit less responsibility.

I’ve been doing a lot of resting and recharging in the last few months - I had 3.5 weeks off between jobs and it was glorious! I was just about feeling like I’d fully reset when it was time to go back to work, but isn’t that always the case? The first few weeks of the new role were fun but stressful, because starting a new job just is (stressful that is), but now that I’m six weeks in I’m feeling a lot more settled and have some headspace to write. So here we go!

## Why burnout?

For this article, I wanted to write from my own experience - if I’m being totally honest, given it was my first post in a while, I didn’t want to do a load of research and tricky technical work - and something that I know a fair bit about is stress, exhaustion and burnout.

I don’t know if this sounds familiar to anyone, but I found myself in a vicious cycle the last year or so: I’d have a break for a week, during which I’d disconnect from work completely, look after myself, rest and recover. I’d go back to work with the best of intentions, telling myself I wouldn’t take on too much and I’d be sure to take breaks and say no. This would last a couple of weeks, maybe a month, at which point I’d end up reverting back to previous behaviours. I’d take on anything and everything again, completely overloading myself and almost burning out, so I’d need to take another week off. Or, sometimes, my body would force me to take a break because I’d end up sick with some kind of respiratory infection. This has been a pretty predictable three month cycle for me and something I wanted to reflect on.

## How do you know whether you’re burned out?

The term “burnout” gets used a lot these days and in a way, I don’t have a problem with that - if it helps folks have words for what they are going through and get help for it, who am I to stop them. Burnout isn’t just being “a bit stressed out” though. It’s this vicious cycle that you can’t seem to get out of, caused by prolonged stress, usually from external factors - this can definitely be work but can also be caring for a family member for example.

It’s deep exhaustion that means you don’t even have the energy to do the stuff that you’d normally enjoy. Whenever I’m in a burnout funk, the last thing I want to do is sew a garment or read a book. I end up vegging in front of the TV after work, which then spirals me even further down because I’m not getting any satisfaction from life. On the surface, this might sound similar to depression and the two can go together, but they are diferent. I am not qualified to talk about how they are different so I would recommend checking out Mental Health UK’s articles on [burnout](https://mentalhealth-uk.org/burnout) and [depression](https://mentalhealth-uk.org/help-and-information/conditions/depression/) if you want to find out more.

## How to burn yourself out

So how did I get here? I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting on this and I feel like there’s a few factors that were within my control here. My hope is that in sharing them with you, I can help you put a stop to things before they get too bad.

### Put pressure on yourself

Achieve, achieve, achieve. That’s the mindset I got myself into. I started my last job as a Senior Engineer, which was a promotion, and I was keen to prove that I was worthy of the role, so I pushed myself, hard. I got two AWS qualifications, I taught myself observability, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code and so much more. When I started I was a front end developer and by the end, I was definitely all over the stack.

I’m not saying any of this to brag, but to show how far I felt I had to go to prove my technical chops. I would say impostor syndrome has a lot to do with this one - I’ve never felt like I’m good enough at the technical stuff, even though I have proven it time and time again. So to reassure myself, I go above and beyond to make sure I know what I’m talking about.

### Don’t say no

I really struggle with that little word “no”. If someone asks me to do something, saying “no” feels like letting them down. Even if I already have a backlog of ten things to do and I can’t possibly fit it into my schedule. Rather than saying “no, I can’t do that right now, can someone else look at it?”, I’d add it to the pile and hope that I’d somehow find the time to do it. This is not a good strategy, don’t fall into that trap! Be honest about your availability - people will respect you for it. Being a doormat is really not a good way to live your life.

### Make everything high priority

On top of not being able to say no, I’d struggle to prioritise things that I was supposed to be doing. My manager would often say to me “you can’t do everything!” (very wise) and my response would be “but I want to!” And that was true - I wanted to work on everything because I found it all interesting and fun, but it was causing me harm. You need to be realistic with yourself about what you can achieve and that means discarding some of your more interesting tasks in favour for the most important one or two that might actually be kind of boring. Prioritisation is *really* hard and I still haven’t found an easy, reliable way to do it. If I figure it out, I’ll write a post about it!

### Do all the things

Take on so much stuff that you can’t *possibly* do it all. In my last role I ran the front end community of practice, a Staff Engineering community, lean coffee chats, gave knowledge sharing talks and who *knows* what else. I’d do all of that on top of many other meetings every day. It’s a wonder I even found time to code - and I did! Looking back, it was definitely way, way too much and I should have either let other people take over or just let those initiatives fade. Don’t put yourself in this position - I know it’s nice to feel like you’re making an impact, but your health and well-being is far more important and you should get the time to do the things that energise you.

## So how do you avoid it?

This is largely about prevention rather than cure. Once you’re in it, burnout is hard to get out of, so it’s important that you take steps now, before it all gets too much.

### Healthy habits

All the usual stuff. Eat well, sleep well, do some kind of movement, even if it’s just going for a walk most days. If you’re into it, meditation helps, because it gets you used to observing your thoughts and feelings without getting stuck in them, making it easier to identify when you are not doing well. There are loads of apps out there that can teach you how to meditate - my favourite by far is Headspace. I also love their sleepcasts for sending me off to sleep at the end of a busy day. I’m not sponsored by them, honest!

### Work on your boundaries

If you struggle with saying no like I do, try and do it as often as you can. Start small - say “no” when a friend asks “do you want to meet up?” and get used to the discomfort of it, the feeling that you might be letting someone down. If they react poorly, that’s their issue, not yours. I know it can feel a bit more scary to say no at work, because at the end of the day, they are paying money for your labour, but a good work culture should give you the space to say “no” without feeling like you’re the worst person in the world.

### Take breaks and rest

I know it can feel difficult to take breaks when you’ve got lots to do, but it’s super important. In fact, I’d argue it’s especially important when you’ve got a lot to do. Clearing your mind and giving yourself space to think will only help you. Go for a quick walk around the block, hang up the laundry or even have a quick break for a cup of tea and a book. Doing something to divert your brain from work might just give you the insight you were looking for, especially if you’re stuck on a tricky problem. I often feel guilty when taking breaks, so I tell myself that my subconscious is still working away at the problem I’ve left behind and taking that break will only help me tackle things from a new perspective.

### Create a good work culture

Everyone has some influence over the culture at work. Some more than others, of course, and what leaders say shapes the culture a lot, but even little things like being there for your colleagues when they need a listening ear, encouraging folks to ask questions and lifting colleagues up rather than shooting them down can make a huge difference. There is no doubt that a stressful workplace will increase burnout, so try your best not to be the person who creates stress for others.

### Be okay with being okay

You don’t have to be extraordinary at your job to earn your pay. It’s perfectly okay to just do a good solid day’s work. I personally don’t agree with hustle culture and this idea that you have to go above and beyond when you’re at work. I know that seems hypocritical given everything I’ve written about above, but it’s true and I’m going to try and live by it. By all means, do a good day’s work, but don’t kill yourself just for your employer’s sake. It really isn’t worth it!

## What to do if you relate

If you’re feeling like you’re heading towards or (god forbid) already in burnout, please talk to someone. Ideally, talk to your manager, because they’re in the best position to help with your workload. If that isn’t possible for whatever reason, usually companies will have Mental Health First Aiders (though they may be called something slightly different) you can reach out to and if you don’t feel comfortable with that, see whether your company has an Employee Assistance Program or EAP. I have called the EAP before when I was really struggling and it was the best thing I ever did. It got me out of a place of enormous anxiety and dread to the point where I was able to deal with work again.

Mental health issues should never be shameful - a lot of people struggle and the worst possible thing is to keep it all to yourself. Not only does that deprive you of the help you need, but it means dealing with stress silently becomes the norm and no-one feels safe talking about it.

And lastly, if you are perpetually burned out and things aren’t getting any better and you have the means, try talking to a mental health professional. They may be able to get you out of the cycle and help create the space for you to recover.

Whatever stage you’re at, I wish you the best of luck. Burnout sucks.
